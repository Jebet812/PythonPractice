## if statements

### Exercise 1

**Alien Colors #1:** Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a 
variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.</br>
•	 Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print 
a message that the player just earned 5 points.</br>
•	 Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)
